# Python1000-Practice-Activities
This free & open project contains additional activities for intermediate Python students, or students who have completed our "Python 1000" Training SERIES. The requirements for these projects *for beginners* are defined using industry-standard UML Use Cases and Activity Diagrams. [Online mentoring](https://takelessons.com/computer-skills/python-lessons/classes/python-by-design) is available.

# Python3000-Missions
If you feel confident in your Python 3, then you might want to go to [Python 3000 Missions](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-missions/learn/lecture/31885106?referralCode=9B7F3A61DA08519BCDA5).

***If you like these type of real-world practice activities, please buy the [Python by Design Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J), and I'll make more. (The book also has my code, as crafted for each activity.)***

If you've no experience with programming, then here is the [Python 1000](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-1000-the-python-primer/?referralCode=A22C48BD99DBF167A3DE).

If you have no experience with Python 3 but know how to program, then jump right in with [Python 1100](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-1100b/?referralCode=8E70E46FA9579E5F3635)

You may also enjoy my [Python interview questions & answers](https://www.amazon.com/100-Python-Questions-Concepts-Interview-ebook/dp/B0BH97B59K) book? 

# Overview
This project has been designed for software developers who are interested in creating software from professionally defined use cases using the most common set of UML diagrams. Pythoneers enrolled in other Python training opportunities will also enjoy these activities.

THE AMAZON BOOK
--------
Recently combined together with the ***official source code*** as well as ***3 bonus exercies*** & no-nonsence career advice, our "Python by Design" is available on Amazon. In addition to the official code and bonus exercises, **Python by Design** also shares a few of the project insights that I use to help me succeed in our modern, profe$$ional software developer world.

The Kindle Edition
-----
Better still, if you are part of Amazon's "Kindle Club" (kindle unlimited) then you & yours might be able to get the book for free. On-line or in paperback, the source code solution to all projects will always be included in the book.

Amazon Opportunity: [Python by Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J)
IN THE BOOK: For any who need a little help or a peek at the code I came up with, the source code is included in the book. Like most books a link to the official support site (eratta, official solutons, etc,) as well as my industry insights / advice, will also be found in that Amazon tome, as well.

Review Concepts
-----
If you need to prepare for an interview, then you may also enjoy our growing **PyQuest** series:
